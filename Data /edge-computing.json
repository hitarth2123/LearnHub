  "introduction": "Edge computing is a distributed computing paradigm that brings computation and data storage closer to the location where it is needed, to improve response times and save bandwidth. It represents a significant shift from the traditional centralized computing model to a more distributed approach.",
  "sections": [
    {
      "title": "How It Works",
      "content": "Edge computing processes data near the source of data generation (like IoT devices) rather than relying on a central data center. This reduces latency and bandwidth usage by processing data locally."

    {
      "title": "Key Benefits",
      "content": "- Reduced latency for time-sensitive applications\n- Lower bandwidth usage and costs\n- Improved privacy and security through local data processing\n- Better reliability with offline capabilities\n- Real-time data processing"
